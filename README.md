### Real-time Image Display Application for the JÃ¼rgen Stock Telescope of Venezuelan National Astronomical Observatory ###



**ABSTRACT**

RIDIA (formerly called RIDIC) displays in real time images captured by digital electronic camera installed on the Jurgen Stock Telescope of Venezuelan National Astronomical Observatory (NAO). It is designed with a client-server architecture, where the Server (RIDIA) receives from Client the numeric values that represent the light intensity of a sky image. Data transfer is done through sockets using the TCP transport protocol. RIDIA captures data and then constructs, processes and displays the digital image through its Graphical User Interface (GUI). RIDIA was developed in C++, using elements provided by the Qt library.
